    <h2><img src="images/bookCover.jpeg" width="100" height="130" />Win At Waiting</h2>
    <p>This book came about from looking for ways to reduce the stress experienced from </p>
    <p>two aspects of modern life:</p>
    <p>1) The pace of life is fast and getting faster, and there never seems to be enough</p>
    <p>time in the day to get done everything we would like to do. </p>
    <p>2) Throughout the day we feel the frustration of being made to wait, something </p>
    <p>that most people don't enjoy doing.</p>
    <p>Willey presents a strategy for coming up with ideas of things to do in any situation </p>
    <p>while waiting in order to turn waiting time into something that is productive and </p>
    <p>enjoyable. This will help you get more done, while at the same time reducing the </p>
    <p>resentment felt towards those that make you wait.</p>

    <h2>Development Team</h2>
    <p>The development team of this site and the Win At Waiting application consisted of </p>
    <p>four senior Ball State undergraduates in their Computer Science capstone, Software </p>
    <p>Engineering. </p>
